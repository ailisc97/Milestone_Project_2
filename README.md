## Purpose
This website was created for Milestone Project 2 in the Software Development Course for Code Insitute. The languages used in the project are the languages which have been thought in the course up until now, which include, HTML, CSS, JS, User Centric Design and Interactive Front End Development.

The live website can be found [here](https://github.com/ailisc97/Milestone_Project_2.git)

## Ping Pong Game Responsive Website

![Website Mock Up] (assets/images/)

Ping Pong Game is based on the popular, and one of the first video games ever created, Pong. Pong was developed in 1972 with the game simulating a Ping Pong Game. User goes up against the computer and is a two dimensional graphic game. Another element of this website is the Contact Form which incorporates the use of EmailJS which is another JavaScript component which I've learned on the course. It gives the user a chance to show off their top score in the hopes to win stickers of the popular game, Pong.

### Structure
All Pages will have a Navigation bar (using Bootstrap) at the top of the Webpage that allows the User to easily navigate between the different pages of the site.
The purpose of this is to fulfill user story:
> As a First Time user, I want to easily and quickly navigate the website to send my Ping Pong Scores.

The Home Page will contain the Ping Pong Game. The purpose of this is to fulfill user story:
> As a First Time user,I want to easily and quickly navigate the website to play the Pong Game.
> As a Frequent user, I want to get better and better at playing the game so my score can increase.

In the Footer there will be links to find the Social Media pages.
> As a First Time user, I want to access the Social Media links.

The Footer will also inform the user when and where the website was made.
>As a First Time user, I want to where the website was made.

The Footer will have contact information for the user to get in touch with the game developers.
> As a Returning User, I want to know how to contact the makers of the game.

The contact page will allow users to tell the people who made the website what score they got, and if they are in with a chance of winning sticker.

## Testing

### Test Strategy 

#### Summary 

Testing is required on Milestone Project 2.


The live Project can be found [here](https://github.com/ailisc97/Milestone_Project_2.git).</br>
#### High Level Test Cases 
![Test Cases](assets/images/)

#### Out of Scope  
* There is no way to save forms.

### Test Results
Testing results can be found [here](assets/images/)<br>
This results are a .xlsx file and will need excel to open. <br>
All Pages were run through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), there was no errors.<br>
CSS Stylesheet was run through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri),there was no errors.<br>

## Deployment

### Project Creation
I created a repository in Github and called it Milestone_Project 2, I selected to add a README into the project. When I went into the repository, I clicked the GitPod button on the top right and that opened GitPod for me. I used Git to add, commit and push all my saved work from GitPod.

*git add . -This would add all the work from the different pages to the GitHub.
*git add index.html -Would only save the work from Index.html
*git pull - This would pull the GitHub version of my project.
*git commit -m "MESSAGE" - This would commit the added work from git add . and leave a message beside it.
*git push- This pushed the added work to GitHub
*python3 -m http.server - This opened the website on the right hand side of the page.
