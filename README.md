## User Experience Design

### User stories

### Structure
All Pages will have a Navigation bar (using Bootstrap) at the top of the Webpage that allows the User to easily navigate between the different pages of the site.
The Navigation bar is collapsable into a hamburger menu on a Mobile device, this will help maximise the space.
The purpose of this is to fulfill user story:
> As a First Time user, I want to view the website and content clearly on my mobile device.

## Deployment

### Project Creation
I created a repository in Github and called it Milestone_Project 2, I selected to add a README into the project. When I went into the repository, I clicked the GitPod button on the top right and that opened GitPod for me. I used Git to add, commit and push all my saved work from GitPod.

*git add . -This would add all the work from the different pages to the GitHub.
*git add index.html -Would only save the work from Index.html
*git pull - This would pull the GitHub version of my project.
*git commit -m "MESSAGE" - This would commit the added work from git add . and leave a message beside it.
*git push- This pushed the added work to GitHub
*python3 -m http.server - This opened the website on the right hand side of the page.
